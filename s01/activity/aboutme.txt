I've been wanting to study programming for a long time, which is why I signed up for the bootcamp. My philosophy is one of constant learning, and I take great satisfaction in continuously improving myself.

I've been a Senior Manager for a number of years. I was the Head of Driver Acquisition and Support at Grab PH for seven years, from 2015 to 2022. In 2023, I left Grab to work as the Global Support Operations Manager at Juniper Networks. Then, in 2024, I became a Country Manager at FoodByUs. Retrenchment was the reason I quit FoodByUs. At this point, I made the decision to change careers and attempt to get into the tech industry.
